# CS316 Assignments - iplC Compiler

These assignments were completed jointly by [Pulkit Agarwal](https://github.com/PulkitAgr113) and [Vaibhav Raj](https://github.com/scimaths) for the course Introduction to Programming Languages Lab (CS316).

It consists of 3 parts:
1. A1 - A lexical analyser built using Flex and Bison.
2. A2 - Symbol table and AST creation, handling checks for grammatical syntax errors, scope checking, type checking and overloading resolution.
3. A3 - 32 bit x86 code generation (correct, but need not be efficient) which is able to handle operators, arrays, pointers, structures, functions (could be nested) similar to GCC.
